# ANN_Regression_Model

I have successfully built an ANN Regression Model to Predict Electrical Energy Output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant.

**#Objective**
Our main objective for this project is to create a regression model using ANN that can predict the hourly net electrical energy output of the CCPP with high accuracy. To achieve this, the model will consider variables such as temperature, ambient pressure, relative humidity, and exhaust vacuum.

The process of building the ANN regression model involves several steps
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Building an ANN
3. Training the ANN
